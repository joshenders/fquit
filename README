"kapp" is a utility that allows you to kill processes by name in OSX. Due to
OSX's unique application bundle convention, you can't always rely on the name
of an application to match the underlying binary that is executing.

`killall <name>` is a common invocation for this task when you know the
binary's name but when you don't, I find `kapp <name>` a lot more convenient
than a `ps` followed by a `kill <pid>`.
